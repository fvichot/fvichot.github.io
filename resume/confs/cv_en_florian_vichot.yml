  - title: "[Cardiac Interventional Guidance using Multimodal Data Processing and Visualisation: medInria as an Interoperability Platform](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00813873/)"
    publisher: "Midas Journal"
    date: "2012"
    authors: "F. Vichot, H. Cochet, B. Bleuzé, N. Toussaint, P. Jaïs, M. Sermesant"
    abstract: "MedInria is a medical imaging application developed at Inria, which aims to provide clinicians with state-of-the-art algorithms for processing and visualising their images. In this article, we focus on its use in pre-surgery preparation for cardiac interventions, and the difficulties arising from the lack of standardisation of certain data formats and visualisation conventions."

  - title: "[IpMorph: fingerprinting spoofing unification](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11416-009-0134-4#/page-1)"
    publisher: "Journal in computer virology 6, no. 4"
    date: "2010"
    authors: "G. Prigent, F. Vichot, F. Harrouet"
    abstract: "Nowadays, there are a variety of tools for easily identifying the TCP/IP stack's fingerprint of a target machine. IpMorph allows this fingerprint to be concealed, and even mimicks the fingerprint of a chosen TCP/IP stack. This is done through live session tracking and packet rewriting. Its effectiveness against tools such as Nmap, Xprobe2, Ring2, SinFP and p0f is also detailed."
